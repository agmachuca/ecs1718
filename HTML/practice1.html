     <h1> Malcolm X</h1> 
     <h2>"X"</h2>
     <h3> Biography</h3>
     <p>Often considered as one of the most significant leaders of African-American Muslim citizens, Malcolm X did his part to inspire many blacks across the United States, to strive for personal freedom. His inspiration came when, in his childhood, his father was seemingly killed by whites, and Malcolm was left an orphan. Also, as a kid, his teachers showed no confidence in him despite his exceptional academic performance. His dream of becoming a lawyer was shattered when it was suggested that carpentry would be a better profession for a black. Initially inspired by his stepsister Ella, he found himself employment, but soon took to unfair means of earning money. During his term at the prison, he was introduced to the tenets preached by the religious organization, 'Nation of Islam'. He was highly motivated by the teachings of Elijah Muhammad, proceeding to spread the same message to others. He soon became famous, but was also often the subject of scrutiny for controversial comments. It was only after leaving the 'Nation of Islam' that he worked hard to attain unity, and gained popularity. He also earned his share of enemies, who eventually assassinated him during one of his public addresses. Even today, this activist is held in high regard by some of the most distinguished human rights leaders.</p>
